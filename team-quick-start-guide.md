# How to VibeCode StoreHub Style ðŸš€
*1-page guide for non-technical team members*

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Copy a template, fill in your requirements, and get StoreHub-branded interfaces without design knowledge.

## ðŸ“‹ Quick 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Copy the Master Template
From `storehub-vibekit.md`, copy this template:

```
Build a [PAGE_TYPE] that feels like StoreHub using these rules:

COLORS: Orange buttons, blue links, gray cards, neutral data
SPACING: Use .section-spacing and .card-grid classes
TYPOGRAPHY: text-xl headings, text-base body, regular font-weight
PERSONALITY: Professional but approachable, generous spacing
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: [YOUR DETAILS HERE]
```

### Step 2: Fill in the Blanks
- **[PAGE_TYPE]**: dashboard, form, settings page, etc.
- **[YOUR DETAILS HERE]**: What you actually need

### Step 3: Run in Cursor
Paste the template, hit enter, and you'll get StoreHub-styled results!

## ðŸŽ¨ Quick Reference Rules

### Colors (Don't Mix These Up!)
- **ðŸŸ  Orange buttons** = Primary actions (Save, Submit, Add New)
- **âšª Gray buttons** = Secondary actions (Cancel, Filter)  
- **ðŸ”µ Blue text** = Links only (never buttons)
- **âš« Dark gray** = Neutral data (sales figures, counts)
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green** = Very good data only (+15% growth)
- **ðŸ”´ Red** = Very bad data only (-10% decline)

### Components You Can Ask For
- **Buttons**: `.btn-primary` (orange), `.btn-secondary` (gray)
- **Cards**: `.card` (main content), `.card-simple` (metrics)
- **Layout**: `.container` + `.section-spacing` + `.card-grid`
- **Logo**: StoreHub-lightbg.png (light backgrounds), StoreHub-darkbg.png (dark)

## âœ… Success Checklist
Your result feels "StoreHub" if:
- [ ] Orange buttons stand out for main actions
- [ ] Spacing feels generous, not cramped
- [ ] Text hierarchy is clear (big â†’ medium â†’ small)
- [ ] Cards group content logically
- [ ] Logo appears in header
- [ ] No blue buttons (blue = links only!)

## ðŸš¨ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Don't** use blue buttons (confuses with orange primary)
- **Don't** use orange/blue for data (causes UI confusion)
- **Don't** mix spacing - use .card-grid and .section-spacing
- **Don't** make buttons bold - keep regular font-weight

## ðŸ’¡ Example Templates Ready to Use

**Dashboard:**
```
Build a sales dashboard with metric cards, data table, and "Add Product" primary button
```

**Form:**
```
Build a customer form with input fields, orange submit button, and gray cancel button
