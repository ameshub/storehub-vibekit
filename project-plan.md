# StoreHub VibeCode Enablement Project
*Getting non-technical team members productive with cohesive StoreHub styling in 3 weeks*

## ðŸŽ¯ Ultimate Goal
Enable any StoreHub team member to tell Cursor "build me a [dashboard/form/page]" and get something that looks cohesively StoreHub without needing design knowledge.

## ðŸ“‹ What Success Looks Like
A vibe coder can copy-paste a prompt template, fill in the blanks, and get StoreHub-branded results that don't need design review.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Tomorrow

### Your First Action:
Take your navbar image and tell Cursor:

*"Analyze this StoreHub interface and help me extract CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, and typography. I need 5-8 color variables, 4-5 spacing values, and 3-4 text size/weight combinations that I can use as the foundation for a design system."*

### Week 1 Daily Goal:
Extract 2-3 CSS variables or personality principles per day. By Friday, you should have enough foundation to build your first prompt template.

### The Key Insight:
You're not building a design system - you're building a **productivity tool**. Every decision should optimize for "can a non-technical person get good results quickly?"

Ready to turn your navbar into a vibecoding superpower! ðŸŽ¨âš¡
